  "readme": "IP2Location Node.js Module\n==========================\n\nThis Node.js module provides a fast lookup of country, region, city, latitude, longitude, ZIP code, time zone, ISP, domain name, connection type, IDD code, area code, weather station code, station name, mcc, mnc, mobile brand, elevation, and usage type from IP address by using IP2Location database. This module uses a file based database available at IP2Location.com. This database simply contains IP blocks as keys, and other information such as country, region, city, latitude, longitude, ZIP code, time zone, ISP, domain name, connection type, IDD code, area code, weather station code, station name, mcc, mnc, mobile brand, elevation, and usage type as values. It supports both IP address in IPv4 and IPv6.\n\nThis module can be used in many types of projects such as:\n\n - select the geographically closest mirror\n - analyze your web server logs to determine the countries of your visitors\n - credit card fraud detection\n - software export controls\n - display native language and currency \n - prevent password sharing and abuse of service \n - geotargeting in advertisement\n\nThe database will be updated in monthly basis for the greater accuracy.
